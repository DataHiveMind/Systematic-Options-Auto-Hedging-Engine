# Systematic Options Auto‑Hedging Engine

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **systematic options auto‑hedging framework** designed to dynamically manage risk exposures in real time. It combines **options theory, stochastic modeling, execution simulation, and reproducible research infrastructure** to demonstrate how a modern quant desk might approach automated hedging of equity derivatives.

The engine is modular, auditable, and research‑grade — built to highlight both **theoretical mastery** and **production‑oriented engineering practices**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Dynamic Hedging:** Maintain delta‑neutral or gamma‑scaled exposures under evolving market conditions.
- **Execution Simulation:** Model realistic fills, slippage, and transaction costs using a simulated limit order book.
- **Performance Attribution:** Quantify hedging error, PnL decomposition, and cost efficiency across volatility regimes.
- **Reproducibility:** Ensure every experiment is fully documented, versioned, and auditable.

---

## 🧩 Core Components

### 1. Greeks Engine

- Computes Δ, Γ, Θ, Vega under **Black‑Scholes** and **Heston stochastic volatility** models.
- Validated against closed‑form benchmarks and stress‑tested across volatility surfaces.

### 2. Hedging Policies

- **Delta‑Neutral:** Classic hedge to eliminate first‑order exposure.
- **Gamma‑Scaled:** Adjusts hedge aggressiveness based on convexity risk.
- Configurable via YAML for experiment reproducibility.

### 3. Execution Layer

- **Simulated Limit Order Book (LOB):** Models queue priority, spread dynamics, and liquidity depth.
- **Cost Models:** Captures slippage, bid‑ask spread, and market impact.

### 4. Metrics & Attribution

- **Hedging Error:** Tracks deviation from target exposures.
- **PnL Attribution:** Separates gains/losses into hedge efficiency, transaction costs, and residual risk.
- **Scenario Analysis:** Evaluates performance under calm vs. stressed volatility regimes.

## 🏗️ Architecture

Data → Greeks Engine → Hedging Policy → Execution Simulator → Metrics & Reports

- **Data Layer:** Ingests raw options chains and underlying tick data.
- **Model Layer:** Computes sensitivities and risk exposures.
- **Policy Layer:** Chooses hedge actions based on config.
- **Execution Layer:** Simulates order placement and fills.
- **Analytics Layer:** Produces risk reports, attribution studies, and MLflow‑tracked experiments.

## 📊 Example Use Cases

- **Academic:** Demonstrates mastery of stochastic calculus, volatility modeling, and market microstructure.
- **Recruiter‑Facing:** Shows ability to design **end‑to‑end trading infrastructure** with professional documentation.
- **Desk‑Facing:** Prototype for auto‑hedging workflows that could be extended to production systems.

## 🔬 Research Highlights

- **Volatility Regimes:** Backtests across 2008 crisis, 2020 COVID crash, and low‑volatility periods.
- **Policy Comparison:** Delta‑neutral vs. gamma‑scaled hedging efficiency under different liquidity conditions.
- **Execution Sensitivity:** Impact of spread widening and order book depth on hedging costs.

---

## ⚙️ Reproducibility

- **MLflow Tracking:** Every run logs configs, metrics, and artifacts.
- **Config‑Driven:** YAML files define models, policies, and execution environments.
- **Audit‑Ready:** Explicit data type management and schema validation.
